#This is the file that contains ideas for Linux tutorials by user nebojsatomic

1. Make a video about cleaning disk space in Linux ( Ubuntu as first, then Fedora and perhaps some other ).

2. Creating new document from a context menu is something that a lot, a lot of people are used to when working in Windows. One of the most irritating things for a Linux newcomer is being unable to use context menu for creating the files. Eplaining how to do that without using terminal and touch command is something that would be appreciated by a lot of people.
